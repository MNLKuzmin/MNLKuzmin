### Hi there! I'm Maria 👋
I am a data scientist with a background in physics and managerial experience in healthcare
<br>👩‍💻 I bring to the table expertise in Python, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
<br>I am originally from Italy 🇮🇹 and moved to the United States 🇺🇸 about 8 years ago
<br>
 
#### 🧡 I love...
🔍 to explore and learn from real world data, and anything that has to do with science and nature interests me.
<br>🩺 In particular I would like to develop tools for healthcare, to improve the precision of tests, and therefore the level of care given to patients.
<br>I love nature, the outdoors, 🏕 camping, 🪴 my plants, 🤿🐠 swimming, snorkelling, scuba, ⛵️ sailing and chilling on the beach 🏖
<br>🍳I also love to cook and in my spare time I draw and I'm trying to learn Spanish
